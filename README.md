# Switchboard SDK – C++ Extension Template

[![Build](https://github.com/switchboard-sdk/cpp-extension-template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/switchboard-sdk/cpp-extension-template/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Welcome to the **Switchboard SDK C++ Extension Template**! This repository provides a streamlined starting point for developers building custom C++ extensions for the Switchboard SDK. With this template, you can set up your development environment quickly and start implementing your own audio processing nodes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

We recommend compiling and running the provided code before making any changes. This will help you understand the structure and workflow of the project.

Key components:
- **`tasks.py`**: Contains [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) commands for common development tasks.
- **CMake**: The project uses standard CMake tooling for cross-platform builds.

### 🔧 Example Nodes

This repository includes three example node implementations to demonstrate the architecture:

| Name               | Path                                                      | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ExampleSource`    | `src/all/Nodes/ExampleSource/ExampleSourceNode.cpp`       | Generates a sine wave with adjustable frequency and amplitude.    |
| `ExampleProcessor` | `src/all/Nodes/ExampleProcessor/ExampleProcessorNode.cpp` | Applies a gain adjustment to the input signal.                    |
| `ExampleSink`      | `src/all/Nodes/ExampleProcessor/ExampleProcessorNode.cpp` | Measures peak input levels and emits events at defined intervals. |

Each node includes two demo projects located in the `demos/` directory:

- **Real-time demo**: Uses `RealtimeGraphRenderer` to process audio from the system mic and play it through the speakers.
- **Offline demo**: Uses `OfflineGraphRenderer` to process audio files and generate output files.

We recommend running these demos to familiarize yourself with how nodes integrate into the SDK.

## 🛠 Creating Your Extension

The current project is named `ExampleDSP`. To personalize it:

```bash
inv rename
```

This will update the project name and references throughout the codebase. You can then modify the existing examples or start from scratch with your own nodes.

---

## 🏗 Building the Extension

Use the platform-specific `build` command to compile the extension:

For example, on Linux:

```bash
inv build-linux
```

Additional build commands are available for other platforms. Refer to `tasks.py` for the full list.
